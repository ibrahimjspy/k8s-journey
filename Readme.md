## 📚 Program Structure

Each step is organized in its own folder (`step-01-...`, `step-02-...`, etc.), and includes:

* ✅ Clear learning goals
* 🧠 Concept explanations
* 🛠 YAML manifests
* 🧪 Hands-on `kubectl` commands
* 📝 A `README.md` inside each step with detailed documentation

cat README.md
```

Each folder has:

* `.yaml` manifests
* Command usage
* Deep explanation in `README.md`

### 🛠 Tools Required

* `kubectl`
* `Docker Desktop` / `Minikube` / `Kind`
* (Optional) Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus, etc. for later steps
